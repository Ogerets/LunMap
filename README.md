# LunMap

Simple app, which shows buildings on sale on Kyiv Map with basic info.

### Setup

This app uses Carthage to manage dependencies.
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To link frameworks to app, run the following command:

```bash
$ carthage update
```
